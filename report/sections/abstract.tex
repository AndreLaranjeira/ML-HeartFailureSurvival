\chapter*{Abstract}

This graduation project report consists of a comparison between multilayer perceptron and random forest machine learning models trained to predict heart failure survival and of an auxiliar website to facilitate the use of the best machine learning model. The machine learning models were evaluated based on the best average of prediction accuracies for 20 validation subsets and 100 test subsets. In total, 5346 machine learning models were evaluated and the best model displayed an average of prediction accuracies on par with the results obtained in an article referenced by this thesis. The auxiliar website was also successful in simplifying access to the best machine learning model. For future works, we plan on evaluating more classes or categories of machine learning models and more combinations of hyperparameters and to test the best machine learning model with contemporary patients.
